This repository is a mirror of my customized ~/.claude configuration.  The goal
is to be able to package it and share it with other developers who are NOT
on the same team(s) as me, and who do not work on any of the same material.
It will be shared PUBLICLY, and needs to, as such, contain NO SENSITIVE INFORMATION.


TODO:

### Priority 7: Cross-Repository Context [ ] TODO

**Problem:** No understanding of dependencies across repositories

**Solution:**
- Parse dependency manifests
- Fetch/clone dependent repos
- Synthesize dependency interface contracts
